# tmux-rs

A rust port of [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

## Why?

Why not? This a fun hobby project for me. It's been my gardening for the past year.

Why not just use [zellij](https://zellij.dev/)? I like tmux. I want tmux,
not something else.

## Installation

Currently only Linux is supported. I've only tested on Debian 12. Like `tmux` it
requires `libevent2` and `libtinfo` (usually packaged with ncurses).

```sh
sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev libevent-dev
cargo install tmux-rs
tmux-rs
```

Also don't run tmux-rs if there is an existing tmux session running in
the background. I haven't tested this and it could result in crashes of
the original tmux session.
